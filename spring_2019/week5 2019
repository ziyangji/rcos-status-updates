Thanks to one of the members in the group, we get the information of the menu each day through the python file.

For me, it's a whole new way to get the information from the website which is called web crawler, I seacrch on the internet about how to use
this tool to get the information. Although our groupe member has already done, it's still worth for me to learn this way.

first we need

pip install pipenv

and then

pipenv install

finally, when we install it we type in

pipenv shell

There is a website called Jupyter which can help me to do some example and show the code

we need to import 
 
from requests_html import HTMLSession 

then we create a session

session = HTMLSession()

then

url = 'https://' (type in the url we need)

we can get the website back here

r = session.get(url)

we can see what we get here

print(r.html.text)


For the following week I will focus on what information is I really need because there are lots of information here, so we need to
to classify them.
