Our project aims to make the menu in the dinning hall online, so I went to different dinning halls on campus and I 
found it hard for us to get the data (plenty of foods serve in the dining hall and vary from each dinning hall).
So one thing to think about is how to get the data, maybe we can contact to the superior to get help.

I am working on this problem in the following days and hope I can find a solution soon.
