This week I am doing things on avoid JS injection attacks.

First, I learnt what is JS injection attack, "The essence of JS Injection is to inject the Javascript code, that will be run from the client-side."

Second, I learnt how to test JS Injection, the first thing you should do is to check if JS Injection is possible or not by using 
javascript:alert(‘Executed!’);

So Firstly, in order to prevent this attack, every received input should be validated. Input should be validated every time, 
and not just when the data is initially accepted. Also, it is recommended to perform an important logic in the server side.
Many try to protect against Javascript Injection by changing the quotes to double and Javascript code should not be performed in that way.

There are three ways to test the injection
Manually
With testing tools
With browser plugins

and we use the index.html file to test the injection attack.
