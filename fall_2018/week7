Last week professor Turner mentioned my weekly update loss some parts, so this week I will follow the template.

Last week I tried to login to the ssh server of rpi by using terminal but I am not sure how to use it to store the contents for our web. 
This really bother me so I contact Shoshana to find the solution.

For this week, if the server can work fine, I will try to use the server to update the website, I think we have already got the frame of it,
so the work will not be hard.

One thing really confused me is I don't know how the server will look like, so I don't know the file path.
