Last week I tried to login to the ssh server of rpi by using terminal and I learned how to use it, like adding contents to it.
I also find some bugs should be fixed on the website, like the map can not show preperly.

For this week, I will try to fix the the bugs on the website and make it work better, like show the picture more smothly. 

One thing about the map, it show the map only for development propurse  but I don't know how to apply for that.
