In these days we are working on the first milestone for this semester, so I am reading the codes on Github from the previous semester. We have limited time for the first semester since our presentation is on Oct 19th and we have to show something new and different from what we did. It's kind of challenge for me to go through all the codes and know how to use them, but fortunately, our group members can study the code together.

In the following week, I would like to try some new features and test whether they could work.
